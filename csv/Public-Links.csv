"bio","As a licensed clinical social worker I will provide therapy and partner with individuals and families helping them achieve their determined goals. I specialize in assisting clients who have experienced trauma, grief, addictions, anxiety, depression, crisis pregnancy, infertility, and adoption. From a 'strengths based perspective', I support clients through a variety of ways to gain insight into how their thoughts and emotions impact behavior and how the past can affect the present and determine the future.

I have life experience as a former military wife for 22 years and know personally the unique challenges faced by service personnel and their families as they face deployment and relocation.","Professional bio."
