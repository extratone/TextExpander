        <p style="margin:0">In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake
            Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the
            human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing
            moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of *The
            Nice, Huge Estate*, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop,
            brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let
            down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of
            the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the
            spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.<br><br>Theodore Pith’s big old
            house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for
            its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within
            one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the
            most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further
            enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to
            Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting,
            especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already
            established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently
            around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years –
            on these walks he was *especially* reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such
            absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained
            wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints –
            generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of
            their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two –
            these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers
            would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in
            his sight and more at any moment – it was all *his*, without a single worthy challenger.<br><br>In the right
            hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and
            all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity
            of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty
            streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a
            single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d
            walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been *even more*
            otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons.
            Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master
            bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from
            Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at *Nice, Huge* – as the puppy he never had, and
            expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of
            amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games
            than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had
            closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most
            secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and
            Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.<br><br>The latest favorite pastime of *Nice, Big*’s Master
            necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household
            staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the
            earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop
            after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep
            black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding
            penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.<br><br>“Hope
            you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp
            light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its
            chain.<br><br>…<br><br>“You’re not *busy*, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of
            his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a
            full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood.
            The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his
            open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore
            Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime
            peace.<br><br>…<br><br>“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to
            his bedside.<br><br>“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”<br><br>…<br><br>Finally, he’d resorted to
            tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the
            sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his
            nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.<br><br>“I need a favor.
            The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”<br><br>Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather
            had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his
            arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the
            soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his
            already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip
            and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when
            he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep
            black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say
            *guffaw.*<br><br>…<br><br>“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to
            be.”<br><br>Lenny Lather had not… *could not* have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking
            pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the
            heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing
            and whooping together with Theodore Pith.<br><br>“Jesus *Christ!*” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the
            stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the
            retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that
            had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an
            asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously
            luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the
            license plate – which had said *BLOOD* in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the
            time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was
            full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the
            cabin, Pith had been *guffawing* plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead
            of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation
            of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief,
            unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-*guffawing* – hanging
            half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.<br><br>As he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop
            of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less
            grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in
            motion.<br><br>“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful
            approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of
            history, struggling for breath.<br><br>“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a
            contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if
            anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket
            that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great
            length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down
            that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of
            the heatless wind.<br><br>“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”<br><br>…<br><br>“Right-o, as you
            say, sir!”<br><br>…<br><br>“Down to the *pu-hb* for a *spaht* of *brahn*-dee with me
            *mae-its*!”<br><br>…<br><br>“*Oncemo-ar* right, pip pip!”<br><br>…<br><br>“By *jah-lee*, there we
            are!”<br><br>…<br><br>After the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently
            forgotten, the Duesenberg named *BLOOD* had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled
            hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the
            cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43,
            two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been
            halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far
            sliding airlock doors. The first to spot *BLOOD* had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary
            scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed,
            and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast
            upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and
            loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment
            engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between
            long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late
            hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as *BLOOD* had crept
            through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details
            of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle,
            one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested
            wonder.<br><br>“*Jesus Christ*,” had said the shortest.<br><br>“*Holy fuck,*” had said the
            youngest.<br><br>“*Gee whiz*,” had said the oldest.<br><br>And the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d
            lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes *BLOOD*’s way as she had halted coolly in
            front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the
            gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and
            exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “*FUCK!*”<br><br>The Sucking’s *FUCK*
            and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees
            – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their
            already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as
            possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic *guffaws* with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then
            successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.<br><br>“Stay here and wait at the ready, my
            good… my *best* Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning
            on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as
            to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him
            and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling,
            grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved
            black fingers by the brim.<br><br>“Tally-*ho*, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open
            face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating,
            tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of
            the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to
            stay his instinct to *sneak* for a swift, full-chat *dart*, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced
            embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his *People* Magazine just
            in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails
            disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his
            next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds
            of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like
            segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his
            line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling
            him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, *excuse me*-shouting march toward the
            lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he
            had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in *his* store: all incidental,
            most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his
            Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his
            premium, Food &amp; Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in
            ignorance, but could have even been *in spite*. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most
            merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d
            taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling,
            fast-rising fury.<br><br>Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of
            Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his *excuse me* lungs
            in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new,
            Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors
            in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation
            of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys &amp; Leather.<br><br>“Sir! Excuse
            me!”<br><br>…<br><br>“*Excuse me!* Sir!”<br><br>…<br><br>Theodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his
            intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack
            bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where
            it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.<br><br>…<br><br>“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar
            – put it out immediately!”<br><br>Keys &amp; Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the
            same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to
            swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his
            two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.<br><br>…<br><br>“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to
            put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go
            about-”<br><br>“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind
            the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing,
            and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass
            lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys &amp; Leather, meanwhile,
            had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes
            knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating
            sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed
            his hesitation *and* arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of
            the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy
            to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to
            deflect its incoming mass.<br><br>“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis
            of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed
            against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his
            belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his
            store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane
            in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and
            fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight
            grip on the wheel with a lampoonish *haha!* before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous
            cackle.<br><br>“Man, *come on*,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets,
            struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were
            interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding
            doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown
            jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the
            ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by
            the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five
            hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to
            sob.<br><br>After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the
            varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence
            of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their
            grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who
            first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the
            duration that *BLOOD* and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead
            Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by
            the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the
            hell can’t you just leave me *alone*?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the
            waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist –
            who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box
            for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had
            thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of
            courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best
            to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant,
            professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared
            to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between
            his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come
            rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had
            three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief
            absence.<br><br>“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in
            first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting
            and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they
            did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the
            Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had
            found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the
            footwell.<br><br>“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back
            seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her
            clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As *BLOOD*’s
            razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable
            to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-*BOOM!*”<br><br>Though the Lake
            Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality
            of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit
            of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and
            effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and/or
            lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify *BLOOD* by *name* from the grainiest
            image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the
            products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation
            was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping
            trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant
            alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and
            quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their
            *effectiveness*, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.</p>

        <p style="margin:0"># The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Phall<br><br>by Edgar Allan Poe<br><br>THERE IS,
            strictly speaking, but little similarity between this sketchy trifle and the very celebrated and very
            beautiful "Moon-story" of Mr. Locke- but as both have the character of hoaxes, (although one is in the tone
            of banter, the other of downright earnest) and as both hoaxes are on the same subject, the moon- the author
            of "Hans Phaall" thinks it necessary to say, in self-defense, that his own jeu-d'esprit was published, in
            the Southern Literary Messenger, about three weeks previously to the appearance of Mr. L's in the New York
            "Sun." Fancying a similarity which does not really exist, some of the New York papers copied "Hans Phaall,"
            and collated it with the Hoax- with the view of detecting the writer of the one in the writer of the
            other.<br><br>By late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state of philosophical
            excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected- so entirely novel-
            so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions- as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all
            Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears. date), a
            vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the
            Exchange in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm- unusually so for the season- there was
            hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled
            with friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a
            fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation
            became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and, in an instant
            afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously
            from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of
            Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam.<br><br>The origin of
            this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined
            masses of cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a queer,
            heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to be in
            any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood
            open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and devils in Rotterdam, what could it
            possibly portend? No one knew, no one could imagine; no one- not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von
            Underduk- had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be
            done, every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right
            eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly- then waddled back,
            grunted, paused, and finally- puffed again.<br><br>In the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward
            the goodly city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. In a very few minutes
            it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It appeared to be- yes! it was undoubtedly a species of
            balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard
            of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the
            very noses of the people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question,
            and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had ever before known to
            be used for a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. As
            to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better than a
            huge foolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer
            inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of
            the cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a continual tinkling to the
            tune of Betty Martin. But still worse. Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there
            hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver bat, with a brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown
            with a black band and a silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of Rotterdam
            swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with
            eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Phaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful
            surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself. Now this was a circumstance the
            more to be observed, as Phaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five
            years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of this narrative all attempts
            had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones which were
            thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a
            retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a
            foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans Phaall and his
            associates. But to return.<br><br>The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within a
            hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its
            occupant. This was in truth a very droll little somebody. He could not have been more than two feet in
            height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt
            him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the
            breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The body of the little man was more than proportionately
            broad, giving to his entire figure a rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen at all,
            although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of
            the car, or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large. His hair was
            extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind. His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory;
            his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and
            double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of
            his head. This odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to
            match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest was of some bright yellow material; a white
            taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk
            handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic
            bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.<br><br>Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet
            from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and
            appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand
            from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant. He then
            proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco
            pocket-book. This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise, and was
            evidently astonished at its weight. He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with
            red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster,
            Superbus Von Underduk. His Excellency stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed,
            and having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy
            preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to
            reascend, the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty
            their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled
            him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in Rotterdam. It is not to be
            supposed, however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to
            pass off with impunity. It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his one-and twenty
            circumvolutions he emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which
            he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his
            death.<br><br>In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above the city, at length
            drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever
            to the wondering eyes of the good citiezns of Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to the letter, the
            descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person
            and personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk. That
            functionary, however, had not failed, during his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the
            important subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into
            the most proper hands, being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official
            capacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly opened
            by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very
            serious, communications.<br><br>&gt; To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and
            Vice-President of the States' College of Astronomers, in the city of Rotterdam.<br><br>&gt; Your
            Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by name Hans Phaall, and by occupation a
            mender of bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner
            which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. If, however, it
            so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Phaall himself. It
            is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty years I continued to occupy the
            little square brick building, at the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of
            my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind- they, as well as myself, steadily
            following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows. For, to speak the truth,
            until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics, no better business
            than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good, employment was
            never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we
            soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing.
            People who were formerly, the very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of us
            at all. They had, so they said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the
            march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a
            newspaper, and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in
            proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in
            need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state of things not to be endured. I
            soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length became
            intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to
            my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation. My house was literally besieged
            from morning till night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of
            his enclosure. There were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch
            continually about my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I internally vowed the
            bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in
            the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate
            execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath,
            and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of
            vengeance should be afforded me.<br><br>&gt; One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more
            than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object
            whatever, until at length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller's stall. Seeing a chair
            close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened
            the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on
            Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar
            name. I had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more
            absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of
            what was passing around me. By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But the
            treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I
            revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer. There
            are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner. The
            longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me. The
            limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with
            natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or
            inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther
            stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude
            ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all
            the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step
            farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate
            source of falsity and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of
            its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her,
            than in the actual situations wherein she may be found. Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of
            these ideas. In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish
            a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as
            when I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware that
            this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible of feeble
            impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind,
            came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices of my
            former humble situation in life, and forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the
            epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had
            already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the
            course which I afterwards pursued.<br><br>&gt; It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to
            bed. My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried in meditation.
            Arising early in the morning, and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired
            eagerly to the bookseller's stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some
            volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every
            spare moment to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought
            sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to
            conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally succeeded- partly by
            selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of
            paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance
            in which I solicited their services. By these means- for they were ignorant men- I found little difficulty
            in gaining them over to my purpose.<br><br>&gt; Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my
            wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow,
            in small sums, under various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no
            inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals,
            cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a
            large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the
            construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as
            soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding. In the
            meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the
            necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some important
            modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then took opportunities of
            conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty
            gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped,
            and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not
            name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas
            never yet generated by any other person than myself- or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The
            secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in
            France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual submitted to me, without
            being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain
            animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility. I found it, however,
            altogether too expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum
            caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter
            the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of,
            and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.<br><br>&gt; On the spot which I
            intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately
            dug a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter. In the
            centre of this circle, being the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth.
            In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a
            keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder. These- the keg and canisters- I connected in a
            proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of
            slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match
            protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the remaining holes, and
            placed the barrels over them in their destined situation.<br><br>&gt; Besides the articles above enumerated,
            I conveyed to the depot, and there secreted, one of M. Grimm's improvements upon the apparatus for
            condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration
            before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe labor
            and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My balloon was
            soon completed. It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I
            calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of
            ballast into the bargain. It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to answer
            all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal less expensive.<br><br>&gt; Everything
            being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my
            first visit to the bookseller's stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as circumstances would
            permit, I gave her what little money I had left, and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no fear on her account.
            She was what people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I
            believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing
            but building castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark night when I bade her
            good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble, we
            carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the other
            articles were deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to
            business.<br><br>&gt; It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there was not a star
            to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief anxiety
            was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather
            heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with
            great diligence, pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others. They did
            not cease, however, importuning me with questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and
            expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could not perceive, so they
            said, what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such
            horrible incantations. I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe the
            idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing
            was nothing better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether. I
            contrived, however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring
            the present business to a termination. To these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation;
            fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and
            provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they
            cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass.<br><br>&gt; In about four hours and a half I
            found the balloon sufficiently inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in it- not
            forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such as
            pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a
            pair of pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure.
            Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick it
            up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before, protruded a very little
            beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the
            three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth, and was
            pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden
            ballast, and able to have carried up as many more.<br><br>&gt; Scarcely, however, had I attained the height
            of fifty yards, when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner, came so
            dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and
            blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car, trembling with
            unmitigated terror. Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business, and that the main
            consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all the
            blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget,
            burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When I afterward had time for
            reflection, I did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its
            proper cause- my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power. But at the time, I
            thought only of preserving my life. The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled
            round and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me
            with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward,
            and my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through
            a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most
            providentially entangled. It is impossible- utterly impossible- to form any adequate idea of the horror of
            my situation. I gasped convulsively for breath- a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve
            and muscle of my frame- I felt my eyes starting from their sockets- a horrible nausea overwhelmed me- and at
            length I fainted away.<br><br>&gt; How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must,
            however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found
            the day breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to
            be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations, however, upon thus
            recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of
            incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation. I drew up to my eyes each of my
            hands, one after the other, and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins,
            and the horrible blackness of the fingemails. I afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly,
            and feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not, as I had more
            than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets,
            and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance,
            and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered great
            uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through
            my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it
            was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in extricating myself from
            this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt.
            For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of
            frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other
            gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of
            intricacy or importance. Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution
            and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the
            waistband of my inexpressibles. This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great
            difficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the body of the
            buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that position. Holding the instrument thus obtained within
            my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to rest several times before I could
            accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast the
            buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist. Drawing now my body
            upwards, with a prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing the
            buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the
            wicker-work.<br><br>&gt; My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle of about
            forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the
            perpendicular. So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the change of
            situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position,
            which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that when
            I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon, instead
            of turned outwardly from it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which I was
            suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,-
            I say it may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been unable to
            accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Phaall would have
            been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I
            was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that
            extraordinary manner, without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil
            state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded
            horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so long
            accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness
            and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was thus
            added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to
            encounter it. But this weakness was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came to my
            rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at
            length, clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell headlong
            and shuddering within the car.<br><br>&gt; It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself
            sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I then, however, examined it with attention,
            and found it, to my great relief, uninjured. My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost
            neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident
            was entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found it six o'clock. I was still rapidly
            ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately beneath me
            in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way
            bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear
            upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily in
            the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun,
            which had long arisen.<br><br>&gt; It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the object
            of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at
            length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide. It was not, however, that to life itself I had
            any, positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my
            situation. In this state of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the
            bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then finally made up my mind. I determined to depart, yet
            live- to leave the world, yet continue to exist- in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what would
            ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than I
            actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an
            achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not
            absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible.<br><br>&gt; The moon's actual distance
            from the earth was the first thing to be attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the centres
            of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth's equatorial radii, or only about 237,000 miles. I say the mean
            or average interval. But it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon's orbit being an ellipse of
            eccentricity amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, and the earth's
            centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its
            perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished. But, to say nothing at present of this
            possibility, it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the
            radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual
            interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles. Now this, I reflected, was no very
            extraordinary distance. Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per
            hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would take me no
            more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. There were, however, many particulars inducing me to
            believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour,
            and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more
            fully hereafter.<br><br>&gt; The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance. From
            indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at
            the height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that at
            10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from the elevation of
            Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air
            incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the
            earth's diameter- that is, not exceeding eighty miles- the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal
            life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining
            the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I did not fail to
            perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the
            properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called,
            comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for
            granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable
            distance from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be simply analogical.
            The greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of
            Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in
            question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for
            speculation.<br><br>&gt; But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude, the
            ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the
            additional height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio
            constantly decreasing. It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally
            speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found. It must exist, I argued; although it
            may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction.<br><br>&gt; On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have
            not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere, beyond which there
            is absolutely no air whatsoever. But a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for
            such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very serious
            investigation. On comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke's comet at its
            perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions
            of the planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the
            comet's ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease. Now, this is precisely what
            ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal
            medium pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a medium must, in retarding the
            comet's velocity, increase its centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the sun's
            attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the comet would be drawn nearer at every
            revolution. Indeed, there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question. But again. The real
            diameter of the same comet's nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate
            with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz,
            that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I
            have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped
            phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention. This radiance, so apparent in
            the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely
            upward, and follows generally the direction of the sun's equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature
            of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed
            indefinitely farther.* Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet's ellipse,
            or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun. It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the
            entire regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves,
            and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological.<br>&gt; *The
            zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called Trabes. Emicant Trabes quos docos vocant.- Pliny, lib.
            2, p. 26.<br><br>&gt; Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further hesitation. Granting
            that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I
            conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily be enabled to
            condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration. This would remove the chief obstacle in
            a journey to the moon. I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object
            intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful application, if I could manage to complete the
            voyage within any reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to
            travel.<br><br>&gt; It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from the earth, are
            known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate. Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the
            superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does
            not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives successively in
            atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing- I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in
            this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware
            that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such
            should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons
            ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that
            the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. I now
            considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove
            to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little
            difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it- that is to say, in regard to my power
            of ascending- for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar
            (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to
            prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any
            compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly
            diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously
            accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth's attraction
            would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to
            encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.<br><br>&gt; There
            was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some little disquietude. It has been observed,
            that, in balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great
            uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and other
            symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude
            attained.* This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was it not probable that these symptoms
            would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their
            origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the
            surface of the body, and consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels- not in any positive
            disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric
            density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart. Unless for
            default of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in a
            vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular,
            and the cause, not the effect, of respiration. In a word, I conceived that, as the body should become
            habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually diminish- and to
            endure them while they continued, I relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my
            constitution.<br>&gt; *Since the original publication of Hans Phaall, I find that Mr. Green, of Nassau
            balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts, deny the assertions of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of
            a decreasing inconvenience,- precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of
            banter.<br><br>&gt; Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by no means all, the
            considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before you the
            result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in
            the annals of mankind.<br><br>&gt; Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three miles
            and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with
            sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast. I was glad of this, for
            I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which will be explained in the
            sequel. I as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain
            whatever in the head. The cat was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the
            pigeons with an air of nonchalance. These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily
            employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car.<br><br>&gt; At
            twenty minutes past six o'clock, the barometer showed an elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a
            fraction. The prospect seemed unbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical
            geometry, what a great extent of the earth's area I beheld. The convex surface of any segment of a sphere
            is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the
            sphere. Now, in my case, the versed sine- that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath me- was about
            equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface. "As five miles, then, to
            eight thousand," would express the proportion of the earth's area seen by me. In other words, I beheld as
            much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe. The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror,
            although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation. The ship was
            no longer visible, having drifted away, apparently to the eastward. I now began to experience, at intervals,
            severe pain in the head, especially about the ears- still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom. The
            cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.<br><br>&gt; At twenty minutes before seven,
            the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing
            apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it
            possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation. I thought it best,
            however, to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one hundred and
            sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had
            obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my leaving the cloud, a flash of
            vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast
            extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal. This, it must be remembered, was in the broad light of
            day. No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place
            amid the darkness of the night. Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as it was, my hair
            stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were,
            and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and
            unfathomable fire. I had indeed made a narrow escape. Had the balloon remained a very short while longer
            within the cloud- that is to say- had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the
            ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence. Such perils, although little considered, are
            perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time, however, attained too great
            an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head.<br><br>&gt; I was now rising rapidly, and by seven
            o'clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I began to find great
            difficulty in drawing my breath. My head, too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a
            moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums
            of my ears. My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have
            protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon
            itself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms were more than I had expected, and occasioned me
            some alarm. At this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three
            five-pound pieces of ballast. The accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly, and
            without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly
            proved fatal to my expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than
            five minutes, and even when this, in a measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and
            in a gasping manner- bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes.
            The pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and,
            with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of
            poison. I now too late discovered the great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast,
            and my agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than death, and death in a few minutes. The
            physical suffering I underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the
            preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my
            head seemed to be greatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses would shortly give way altogether,
            and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when the
            recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself, should
            I return, operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the bottom of the car, and endeavored to
            collect my faculties. In this I so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood. Having
            no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner I was able, and finally
            succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife. The blood had hardly commenced
            flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate basin full,
            most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt
            getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a
            quarter of an hour. At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind
            than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension. The difficulty of breathing, however,
            was diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use
            of my condenser. In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I
            discovered to my infinite surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into
            light a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition to the number of passengers on my part
            altogether unexpected; but I was pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of bringing to a
            kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this
            ascension. I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the
            earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface.
            Should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider my
            theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea.<br><br>&gt;
            By eight o'clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth.
            Thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression
            would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did. The pains in
            my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the
            nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been expected. I breathed, however, at every
            moment, with more and more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action
            of the chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use.<br><br>&gt; The
            view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful indeed. To the westward, the northward, and
            the southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which every
            moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of
            convexity. At a vast distance to the eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great
            Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small portion of the northern part of the
            continent of Africa. Of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of
            mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth. From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a
            dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars,
            spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of waters seemed at
            length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the
            echoes of the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars were brilliantly
            visible.<br><br>&gt; The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I determined upon giving
            them their liberty. I first untied one of them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim
            of the wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and
            making a loud cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car. I took him up at
            last, and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon. He made, however, no attempt to descend as
            I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and
            piercing cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had hardly done so
            when his head dropped upon his breast, and be fell dead within the car. The other one did not prove so
            unfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him
            downward with all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making
            use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. In a very short time he was out of sight, and
            I have no doubt he reached home in safety. Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness,
            now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction. Her kittens
            were quite lively, and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.<br><br>&gt; At a
            quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded
            forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. This apparatus will require
            some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the first
            place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in
            which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by means of my condenser, a
            quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object in
            view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was
            of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over
            the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or
            hoop where the net-work is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete enclosure
            on all sides, and at botttom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material
            over the hoop of the net-work- in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were
            separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in the meantime? Now the net-work
            was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. I therefore
            undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus
            inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops- not to the hoop,
            for that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened- but to a series of large buttons,
            affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons
            having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops. This done, a few more of the loops were
            unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected
            with their proper buttons. In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the
            net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole
            weight of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons.
            This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the buttons were
            not only very strong in themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was
            supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were, I
            should not have been at all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic, and
            propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was
            done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its
            proper situation. All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily
            accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the
            inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.<br><br>&gt; In the sides of the covering thus adjusted
            round the car, had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I could see
            without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction. In that portion of the cloth forming the bottom,
            was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the
            car itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having found it impossible to place any similar
            contrivance overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the consequent
            wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was
            a matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at top, the balloon itself would
            have prevented my making any use of it.<br><br>&gt; About a foot below one of the side windows was a
            circular opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the
            windings of a screw. In this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being,
            of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic. Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere
            circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine, was thence discharged, in
            a state of condensation, to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation being repeated
            several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration. But
            in so confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use from frequent
            contact with the lungs. It was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car- the dense air readily
            sinking into the thinner atmosphere below. To avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment
            within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner- the valve
            being opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump of the
            condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and
            kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom, close by the valve,
            through which I could feed them at any moment when necessary. I did this at some little risk, and before
            closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which
            a hook had been attached.<br><br>&gt; By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the
            chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o'clock. During the whole period of my being thus
            employed, I endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the
            negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the last moment a matter
            of so much importance. But having at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my
            invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease- and indeed why should I not? I was also
            agreeably surprised to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto
            tormented me. A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the wrists, the
            ankles, and the throat, was nearly all of which I had now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a greater
            part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off, as I had
            expected, and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to
            the effects of a deficient respiration.<br><br>&gt; At twenty minutes before nine o'clock- that is to say, a
            short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained its limit, or ran down, in
            the barometer, which, as I mentioned before, was one of an extended construction. It then indicated an
            altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time an
            extent of the earth's area amounting to no less than the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire
            superficies. At nine o'clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not before I became aware
            that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident
            indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro. I observed
            now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea.<br><br>&gt;
            At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve. They did
            not float as I had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the
            greatest velocity- being out of sight in a very few seconds. I did not at first know what to make of this
            extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so
            prodigious an acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain
            even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been
            surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation.<br><br>&gt; By ten o'clock I found
            that I had very little to occupy my immediate attention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon
            to be going upward witb a speed increasing momently although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the
            progression of the increase. I suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I
            had at any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining the state of my various
            apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber. This latter point I determined to
            attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of my health, than from
            so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary. In the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations.
            Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon. Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled,
            roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now there were boary and
            time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without
            a bottom. Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of heaven ever intruded, and
            where vast meadows of poppies, and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all
            silent and motionless forever. Then again I journeyed far down away into another country where it was all
            one dim and vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds. And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of
            tall eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell
            upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled
            with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out, and taking the
            place of their brothers thus entombed. "This then," I said thoughtfully, "is the very reason why the waters
            of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the hours run on." But fancies such as these were
            not the sole possessors of my brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently
            obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of
            their possibility. Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter
            speculations, rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided
            attention.<br><br>&gt; At five o'clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the
            chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve. The cat herself
            appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a
            difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely. I had expected, of
            course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have
            been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure. But I was
            not prepared to find them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing
            with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness
            whatever. I could only account for all this by extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied
            atmosphere around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically insufficient for the purposes
            of life, and that a person born in such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending
            its inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a
            similar nature to those I had so lately experienced. It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an
            awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me of the
            insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded. In passing my hand through the
            valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which
            sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the bottom. Had the whole actually vanished
            into air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner. Positively, there
            could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its
            absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained. My good wishes followed it to the earth, but of
            course, I had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their
            misfortune.<br><br>&gt; At six o'clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth's visible area to the
            eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes
            before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night. It was not, however, until
            long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance,
            although of course fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure. It was evident
            that, in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of
            Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day, in
            proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period. I
            now determined to keep a journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours
            continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness.<br><br>&gt; At ten o'clock,
            feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself,
            which, obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which I am now speaking.
            If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim? To
            breathe it for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this term
            could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue. The consideration of
            this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the dangers I had
            undergone, I should look upon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing
            my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent. But this hesitation was only
            momentary. I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points in the routine of his
            existence are deemed essentially important, which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual.
            It was very certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring myself to feel no
            inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose. It would
            require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and the only real
            difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing. But this was a
            question which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution. To be sure, I had
            heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper,
            the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to
            startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with drowsiness. My own case, however, was very
            different indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep awake, but to be
            aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time. I at length hit upon the following expedient, which,
            simple as it may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention fully equal to that of
            the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of printing itself.<br><br>&gt; It is necessary to premise, that
            the balloon, at the elevation now attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent,
            and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect
            in it the slightest vacillation whatever. This circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now
            determined to adopt. My supply of water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each, and
            ranged very securely around the interior of the car. I unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied
            them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other; placing them about a foot apart
            and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a horizontal
            position. About eight inches immediately below these ropes, and four feet from the bottom of the car I
            fastened another shelf- but made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had. Upon this latter
            shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern pitcher was deposited. I now bored a
            hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical
            shape. This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at
            that exact degree of tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher
            below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes. This, of course, was a matter
            briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time. Having
            arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious. My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to
            bring my head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher. It was evident, that, at the
            expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth,
            which was somewhat lower than the rim. It was also evident, that the water thus falling from a height of
            more than four feet, could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be,
            to waken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the world.<br><br>&gt; It was fully eleven
            by the time I had completed these arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence
            in the efficiency of my invention. Nor in this matter was I disappointed. Punctually every sixty minutes was
            I aroused by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and
            performed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed. These regular interruptions to my slumber
            caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven
            o'clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon.<br><br>&gt; April 3d. I found
            the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the earth's apparent convexity increased in a material degree.
            Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands. Far away to the
            northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon,
            and I had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea. My curiosity
            was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some
            period, find myself placed directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my great elevation would, in
            this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could wish. Much, however, might be ascertained.
            Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day. My apparatus all continued in good order,
            and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation. The cold was intense, and obliged me to
            wrap up closely in an overcoat. When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to bed, although it was
            for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation. The water-clock was punctual in
            its duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical
            interruption.<br><br>&gt; April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the singular
            change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea. It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of
            blue it had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye. The islands
            were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing
            elevation had left them out of sight, it is impossible to say. I was inclined, however, to the latter
            opinion. The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent. Cold by no means so intense.
            Nothing of importance occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with
            books.<br><br>&gt; April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole
            visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness. In time, however, the light spread itself
            over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the northward. It was now very distinct, and appeared of a much
            darker hue than the waters of the ocean. I was evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity. Fancied I
            could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the westward, but could not be
            certain. Weather moderate. Nothing of any consequence happened during the day. Went early to
            bed.<br><br>&gt; April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance, and an
            immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north. It was evident that if
            the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt
            of ultimately seeing the Pole. During the whole of the day I continued to near the ice. Toward night the
            limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth's form being
            that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic
            circle. When darkness at length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over the object
            of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of observing it.<br><br>&gt; April 7th. Arose early,
            and, to my great joy, at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole
            itself. It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas! I had now ascended to so
            vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be discerned. Indeed, to judge from the progression of the
            numbers indicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the second
            of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it
            might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o'clock in the morning of April the seventh,
            reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea. This elevation may
            appear immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior
            to the truth. At all events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth's major diameter; the entire
            northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the
            equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon. Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that
            the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic circle, although situated directly
            beneath me, and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in themselves,
            comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very
            accurate examination. Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting. Northwardly
            from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight qualification, may be called the limit of human
            discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to extend. In the first
            few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane,
            and finally, becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a circular centre, sharply
            defined, wbose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose
            dusky hue, varying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere,
            and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness. Farther than this, little could
            be ascertained. By twelve o'clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference, and by
            seven P.M. I lost sight of it entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating
            away rapidly in the direction of the equator.<br><br>&gt; April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the
            earth's apparent diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance. The whole
            visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a
            brilliancy even painful to the eye. My view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere
            in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I could only now and then
            obtain a glimpse of the earth itself. This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the
            last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating
            bodies of vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent.
            Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the
            continent of North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics. This
            circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of
            ultimate success. Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled me with uneasiness; for it was
            evident that, had I continued it much longer, there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the
            moon at all, whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5 degrees 8'
            48".<br><br>&gt; April 9th. To-day the earth's diameter was greatly diminished, and the color of the surface
            assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow. The balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward, and
            arrived, at nine P.M., over the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf.<br><br>&gt; April 10th. I was suddenly
            aroused from slumber, about five o'clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I
            could in no manner account. It was of very brief duration, but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the
            world of which I had any previous experience. It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed,
            having, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon. I examined all my
            apparatus, however, with great attention, and could discover nothing out of order. Spent a great part of the
            day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of accounting for
            it. Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a state of great anxiety and agitation.<br><br>&gt; April 11th. Found a
            startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for
            the first time, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being full. It now required long
            and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of
            life.<br><br>&gt; April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon,
            and although fully anticipated, afforded me the most unequivocal delight. Having reached, in its former
            course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the
            eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of
            the lunar ellipse. What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of
            this change of route- a vacillation which prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many
            hours.<br><br>&gt; April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud, crackling noise
            which terrified me on the tenth. Thought long upon the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory
            conclusion. Great decrease in the earth's apparent diameter, which now subtended from the balloon an angle
            of very little more than twenty-five degrees. The moon could not be seen at all, being nearly in my zenith.
            I still continued in the plane of the ellipse, but made little progress to the eastward.<br><br>&gt; April
            14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth. To-day I became strongly impressed with the
            idea, that the balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigee- in other
            words, holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit the
            nearest to the earth. The moon itself was directly overhead, and consequently hidden from my view. Great and
            long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere.<br><br>&gt; April 15th. Not even the
            outlines of continents and seas could now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness.
            About twelve o'clock I became aware, for the third time, of that appalling sound which had so astonished me
            before. It now, however, continued for some moments, and gathered intensity as it continued. At length,
            while, stupefied and terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what hideous destruction, the car
            vibrated with excessive violence, and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which I could not
            distinguish, came with a voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and booming by the balloon. When my fears and
            astonishment had in some degree subsided, I had little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic
            fragment ejected from that world to which I was so rapidly approaching, and, in all probability, one of that
            singular class of substances occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric stones for want of a
            better appellation.<br><br>&gt; April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through each of the
            side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great delight, a very small portion of the moon's disk protruding,
            as it were, on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon. My agitation was extreme; for I had
            now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage. Indeed, the labor now required by the
            condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion.
            Sleep was a matter nearly out of the question. I became quite ill, and my frame trembled with exhaustion. It
            was impossible that human nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer. During the now
            brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my vicinity, and the frequency of these
            phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension.<br><br>&gt; April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my
            voyage. It will be remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an angular breadth of twenty-five
            degrees. On the fourteenth this had greatly diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease
            was observable; and, on retiring on the night of the sixteenth, I had noticed an angle of no more than about
            seven degrees and fifteen minutes. What, therefore, must have been my amazement, on awakening from a brief
            and disturbed slumber, on the morning of this day, the seventeenth, at finding the surface beneath me so
            suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume, as to subtend no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent
            angular diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words can give any adequate idea of the extreme, the absolute
            horror and astonishment, with which I was seized possessed, and altogether overwhelmed. My knees tottered
            beneath me- my teeth chattered- my hair started up on end. "The balloon, then, had actually burst!" These
            were the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: "The balloon had positively burst!- I was
            falling- falling with the most impetuous, the most unparalleled velocity! To judge by the immense distance
            already so quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten minutes, at the farthest, before I should meet
            the surface of the earth, and be hurled into annihilation!" But at length reflection came to my relief. I
            paused; I considered; and I began to doubt. The matter was impossible. I could not in any reason have so
            rapidly come down. Besides, although I was evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a speed
            by no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so horribly conceived. This consideration served
            to calm the perturbation of my mind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point
            of view. In fact, amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses, when I could not see the vast
            difference, in appearance, between the surface below me, and the surface of my mother earth. The latter was
            indeed over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the moon- the moon itself in all its glory-
            lay beneath me, and at my feet.<br><br>&gt; The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this
            extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after all, that part of the adventure least
            susceptible of explanation. For the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and inevitable, but had
            been long actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever I should arrive at that exact point
            of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite- or,
            more precisely, where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less powerful than its
            gravitation toward the moon. To be sure I arose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to
            the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon, and one which, although expected, was not expected at the
            moment. The revolution itself must, of course, have taken place in an easy and gradual manner, and it is by
            no means clear that, had I even been awake at the time of the occurrence, I should have been made aware of
            it by any internal evidence of an inversion- that is to say, by any inconvenience or disarrangement, either
            about my person or about my apparatus.<br><br>&gt; It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due
            sense of my situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty of my soul, my
            attention was, in the first place, wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical appearance
            of the moon. It lay beneath me like a chart- and although I judged it to be still at no inconsiderable
            distance, the indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a most striking and altogether
            unaccountable distinctness. The entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake or river, or body of
            water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition.
            Yet, strange to say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial, although by far the
            greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in
            shape, and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance. The highest among them
            does not exceed three and three-quarter miles in perpendicular elevation; but a map of the volcanic
            districts of the Campi Phlegraei would afford to your Excellencies a better idea of their general surface
            than any unworthy description I might think proper to attempt. The greater part of them were in a state of
            evident eruption, and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power, by the repeated thunders
            of the miscalled meteoric stones, which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more
            appalling.<br><br>&gt; April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon's apparent bulk- and the
            evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm. It will be remembered, that, in
            the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the existence, in its
            vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet, had entered largely into my
            calculations; this too in spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of a
            general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all. But, in addition to what I have already
            urged in regard to Encke's comet and the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by certain
            observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal. He observed the moon when two days and a half old, in the
            evening soon after sunset, before the dark part was visible, and continued to watch it until it became
            visible. The two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation, each exhibiting its farthest
            extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays, before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible. Soon
            afterward, the whole dark limb became illuminated. This prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I
            thought, must have arisen from the refraction of the sun's rays by the moon's atmosphere. I computed, also,
            the height of the atmosphere (which could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a
            twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees from the
            new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in this view, I supposed the greatest height capable of refracting the solar
            ray, to be 5,376 feet. My ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the
            eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it is stated that at an occultation of
            Jupiter's satellites, the third disappeared after having been about 1" or 2" of time indistinct, and the
            fourth became indiscernible near the limb.*<br>&gt; *Havelius writes that he has several times found, in
            skies perfectly clear, when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude were conspicuous, that, at the
            same altitude of the moon, at the same elongation from the earth, and with one and the same excellent
            telescope, the moon and its maculae did not appear equally lucid at all times. From the circumstances of the
            observation, it is evident that the cause of this phenomenon is not either in our air, in the tube, in the
            moon, or in the eye of the spectator, but must be looked for in something (an atmosphere?) existing about
            the moon.<br><br>&gt; Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed stars, when approaching the
            moon to occultation, to have their circular figure changed into an oval one; and, in other occultations, he
            found no alteration of figure at all. Hence it might be supposed, that at some times and not at others,
            there is a dense matter encompassing the moon wherein the rays of the stars are refracted.<br><br>&gt; Upon
            the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an atmosphere, existing in the state of density
            imagined, I had, of course, entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent. Should I then, after
            all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in consequence nothing better to expect, as a finale to my
            adventure, than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite. And, indeed, I had now
            every reason to be terrified. My distance from the moon was comparatively trifling, while the labor required
            by the condenser was diminished not at all, and I could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing
            rarity in the air.<br><br>&gt; April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o'clock, the surface of
            the moon being frightfully near, and my apprehensions excited to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at
            length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere. By ten, I had reason to believe its density
            considerably increased. By eleven, very little labor was necessary at the apparatus; and at twelve o'clock,
            with some hesitation, I ventured to unscrew the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience from having done
            so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and unrigged it from around the car. As might have been
            expected, spasms and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and
            full of danger. But these and other difficulties attending respiration, as they were by no means so great as
            to put me in peril of my life, I determined to endure as I best could, in consideration of my leaving them
            behind me momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon. This approach, however, was still
            impetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly certain that, although I had probably not been
            deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I had
            been wrong in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all adequate to the support of the great
            weight contained in the car of my balloon. Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal degree as at
            the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the
            atmospheric condensation. That it was not the case, however, my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough;
            why it was not so, can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological disturbances to which I
            have formerly alluded. At all events I was now close upon the planet, and coming down with the most terrible
            impetuosity. I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing overboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs,
            then my condensing apparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every article within the car. But it was
            all to no purpose. I still fell with horrible rapidity, and was now not more than half a mile from the
            surface. As a last resource, therefore, having got rid of my coat, hat, and boots, I cut loose from the
            balloon the car itself, which was of no inconsiderable weight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the
            net-work, I had barely time to observe that the whole country, as far as the eye could reach, was thickly
            interspersed with diminutive habitations, ere I tumbled headlong into the very heart of a
            fantastical-looking city, and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people, who none of them
            uttered a single syllable, or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance, but stood, like a
            parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous manner, and eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set
            a-kimbo. I turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth so lately left, and left perhaps
            for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull, copper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the
            heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of the most brilliant gold. No
            traces of land or water could be discovered, and the whole was clouded with variable spots, and belted with
            tropical and equatorial zones.<br><br>&gt; Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great
            anxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at length, on the nineteenth day of my
            departure from Rotterdam, arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most
            extraordinary, and the most momentous, ever accomplished, undertaken, or conceived by any denizen of earth.
            But my adventures yet remain to be related. And indeed your Excellencies may well imagine that, after a
            residence of five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character, but
            rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in capacity of satellite, with the world inhabited by man, I
            may have intelligence for the private ear of the States' College of Astronomers of far more importance than
            the details, however wonderful, of the mere voyage which so happily concluded. This is, in fact, the case. I
            have much- very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to communicate. I have much to say of the
            climate of the planet; of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold, of unmitigated and burning sunshine
            for one fortnight, and more than polar frigidity for the next; of a constant transfer of moisture, by
            distillation like that in vacuo, from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it; of a
            variable zone of running water, of the people themselves; of their manners, customs, and political
            institutions; of their peculiar physical construction; of their ugliness; of their want of ears, those
            useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified; of their consequent ignorance of the use and
            properties of speech; of their substitute for speech in a singular method of inter-communication; of the
            incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in the moon with some particular individual
            on the earth- a connection analogous with, and depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and the
            satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the one are interwoven with
            the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your Excellencies-
            above all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moon- regions which,
            owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the satellite's rotation on its own axis with its sidereal
            revolution about the earth, have never yet been turned, and, by God's mercy, never shall be turned, to the
            scrutiny of the telescopes of man. All this, and more- much more- would I most willingly detail. But, to be
            brief, I must have my reward. I am pining for a return to my family and to my home, and as the price of any
            farther communication on my part- in consideration of the light which I have it in my power to throw upon
            many very important branches of physical and metaphysical science- I must solicit, through the influence of
            your honorable body, a pardon for the crime of which I have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon
            my departure from Rotterdam. This, then, is the object of the present paper. Its bearer, an inhabitant of
            the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and properly instructed, to be my messenger to the earth, will await
            your Excellencies' pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if it can, in any manner, be
            obtained.<br><br>&gt; I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies' very humble servant,<br><br>&gt; HANS
            PHAALL.<br><br>Upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document, Professor Rub-a-dub, it is
            said, dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk
            having taken off his spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in his pocket, so far forgot both himself
            and his dignity, as to turn round three times upon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment and
            admiration. There was no doubt about the matter- the pardon should be obtained. So at least swore, with a
            round oath, Professor Rub-a-dub, and so finally thought the illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of
            his brother in science, and without saying a word, began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon
            the measures to be adopted. Having reached the door, however, of the burgomaster's dwelling, the professor
            ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear- no doubt frightened to death by
            the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam- the pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man
            of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of this observation the burgomaster
            assented, and the matter was therefore at an end. Not so, however, rumors and speculations. The letter,
            having been published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion. Some of the over-wise even made
            themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole business; as nothing better than a hoax. But hoax, with these
            sort of people, is, I believe, a general term for all matters above their comprehension. For my part, I
            cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation. Let us see what they
            say:<br><br>Imprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial antipathies to certain
            burgomasters and astronomers.<br><br>Secondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of whose
            ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his head, has been missing for several days from the
            neighboring city of Bruges.<br><br>Thirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon
            were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have been made in the moon. They were dirty papers- very
            dirty- and Gluck, the printer, would take his Bible oath to their having been printed in
            Rotterdam.<br><br>He was mistaken- undoubtedly- mistaken.<br><br>Fourthly, That Hans Phaall himself, the
            druken villain, and the three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no longer than two or
            three days ago, in a tippling house in the suburbs, having just returned, with money in their pockets, from
            a trip beyond the sea.<br><br>Don't believe it- don't believe a word of it.<br><br>Lastly. That it is an
            opinion very generally received, or which ought to be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in
            the city of Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts of the world,- not to mention colleges
            and astronomers in general,- are, to say the least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser
            than they ought to be.</p>

        <p style="margin:0">​​I have pulled a lot of stupid stunts in bars, though I’ve yet to be physically struck in
            one, despite some very persistent attempts at provocation by other parties, and I’m proud of the fact. I’m
            not going to tell to you that you shouldn’t enjoy a good bar fight – especially if you’ve a lust for
            violence that may otherwise manifest in less-than-consensual, more malicious activities – but otherwise, be
            aware that the vast majority of Huffy Yokels can be talked down from even the Most Bothered of dispositions
            with intelligently-applied finesse, should you care to use your time alternatively.<br><br>Of course, one
            would do best not to allow himself and his own designed influence over his outward image and subsequent
            bearing in a given social biome to become rampant and/or obsessive patronization. By nature, such a pursuit
            will only metamorphose into a slope of blisteringly-multiplying inclination which terminates singularly into
            the oxymoronic undoing of itself. A preoccupation with the petty maneuvers of one’s local bar culture tends
            to rapidly illuminate one’s weaknesses like a psychosexual flare gun. Be wary of your own undue satisfaction
            with petty demonstrations of power over the older, more-regional crowd. The greenest patron (those who’ve
            just arrived at legal drinking age, for instance) may find the low-risk, relatively collateral-resistant
            nature of this environment incubatory, at first, but they would do well to agitate their social pool
            astutely, lest they become ensnared in some of the various crud on which the other, ruminating citizens of
            these foul associations have found themselves caught.</p>

            many accounts you can follow on Twitter**. It was finally documented in this [official help
            document](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit), dated March 2019, but for more
            than ten years, it was implemented without any explanation from the service, and was known only to those of
            us who'd actually encountered it.<br><br>Here's what happens when I try to follow a new account from
            [@NeoYokel](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel):<br><br>![Follow Limit
            Notice](https://i.snap.as/qWuogwAX.jpeg)<br><br>I was only able to verify that this has been the case since
            October 20th, 2017 - naturally, I didn't bother to note the actual date I first received that
            notice.<br><br>**If you're a recent follower of mine and you've found this document**, please know that I
            have seen your expressed desire to keep in touch in some way (which is what following someone "says," I
            think we can agree,) and have probably responded by adding you to one of my [Twitter
            Lists](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists). You may have received a notification about this, but if you
            haven't, it's because I have not yet chosen to make the List to which I added you public. <br><br>I also
            want you to know that I am available to speak directly about this if you have questions - whether that be on
            [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), by [email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com), or
            [otherwise](https://davidblue.wtf). Here's my personal phone number: +1 (573) 823-4380<br><br>For whatever
            it's worth, *thanks for the follow*. I hope to hear from you but if I don't, thanks okay, too.</p>

            fairly regularly author and distribute various tool-adjacent configurations you may find of value, I am
            fundamentally *not a builder*, though I am relentlessly compelled to seek out spaces like GitHub where
            builders congregate around the context of work.<br><br>Similar limitations of mine have been allowed to
            prevent me from being all that great of a *fixer*, either, in terms of methodically discovering and
            remedying obstructions. The late, pseudo-monastic theme of my life in the past year has been a resolute
            about-face in my behavioral and emotional reaction to **detail** as an abstract - I have earned or been
            granted (perhaps both) a drastically different sentiment toward the most minute avenues of Software History:
            I have found solace in this theoretical binary plane we have constructed. <br><br>**My highest priority
            right now is learning how to "leverage" my personal growth in a way which produces value for other
            people.**<br><br>I have formally decided to shoulder the burden of thoroughly documenting the stories,
            peculiarities, and most technical details of [**using a Bluetooth keyboard with an
            iPhone**](https://github.com/extratone/keys), but I am determined to do so as collaboratively as possible. I
            have also been documenting various other processes specific to iPhone (read: doing free labor for the most
            valuable company in the history of the world) which I hope to compile throughout the rest of the year into
            entertaining, thoughtful, and *helpful* essays/guides on
            [**bilge.world**](https://bilge.world/tag:software).<br><br>![Editorial Git
            Wood](images/Editorial%20Git%20Wood.png)<br><br>Perhaps the most intriguing (or off-putting) endeavor of
            mine specific to GitHub has been publicly learning how to "[write in
            public](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/)" using Git for version/revision tracking. I
            have discovered I was less original in this concept than I thought, but frankly, this process which I have
            begun to describe as ==[**Editorial Git**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions/86)== cannot be
            thoroughly explored within the context of academia.<br><br>You can find an outline of how I've learned to
            use GitHub for virtually my entire process in the README of [*The Psalms*'
            Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge). Perhaps more importantly, said repository functions as a
            live virtually up-to-the-minute document of my work.<br><br>On the subject of transparency, you are welcome
            to contact me in virtually any medium you wish. This Notion Database functions as a directory of every one
            of my public-facing accounts throughout the Web. I have opted-in to GitHub Sponsors partially to explore it
            for the sake of a potential written analysis of Open Web Patronage Services, but also to express in a
            designed way that I am available to you (here to help) in any manner I can and if you feel compelled to
            reciprocate any value I may have added to your existence with $$$, that, too, will be public, and you will
            have the option of specifying how it's spent, if you wish. (See: [*Extratone*'s "GOD" Patreon
            Tier](https://www.patreon.com/join/extratone/checkout?rid=1110116).)<br><br>However, it'd take a lot of cash
            to equate to the value I'd receive I'd receive from you leaving a voicemail telling the story of the first
            time you saw somebody using a Bluetooth keyboard with their phone in the wild. :) <br><br>Here's my personal
            phone number: **+1 (573) 823-4380**<br><br>Thank you again for your hospitality.</p>
